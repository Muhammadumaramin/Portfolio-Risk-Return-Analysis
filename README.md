# 📊 Portfolio Risk & Return Analysis of U.S. Banks (Excel Project)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive **portfolio risk and return
analysis** of major U.S. banks between **2018--2024** using **Excel**.\
The study evaluates both an **equal-weighted bank portfolio (BAC, C,
JPM, WFC)** and a **two-bank portfolio (JPMorgan & Morgan Stanley)**.

## 🏦 Key Objectives

-   Perform portfolio evaluation using **simple returns, log returns,
    annualized returns, and year-on-year growth**.\
-   Calculate **risk-adjusted metrics**: Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio,
    Treynor Ratio, and Maximum Drawdown.\
-   Conduct **CAPM regression** in Excel to estimate Alpha, Beta, and R²
    against the S&P 500 (SPY).\
-   Develop a **structured risk assessment framework** for identifying
    trends and improving decision-making.\
-   Create **interactive Excel charts**: normalized price trends,
    portfolio cumulative growth vs SPY, rolling volatility, histograms,
    and correlation heatmaps.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

-   **Microsoft Excel** (primary tool)
    -   Data Analysis ToolPak\
    -   Advanced formulas (AVERAGE, STDEV, CORREL, COVAR, etc.)\
    -   PivotTables & Conditional Formatting\
    -   Regression Analysis via Data Analysis add-in

## 📈 Key Findings

-   **JPMorgan** consistently outperformed peers on risk-adjusted
    metrics.\
-   **Citigroup and Wells Fargo** showed weaker performance with higher
    volatility.\
-   **Intra-sector correlations** exceeded 0.80, limiting
    diversification benefits.\
-   The **two-bank portfolio (JPM & MS)** provided stronger returns with
    moderate drawdowns.

## 🚀 How to Use

1.  Open the Excel file:\
    `Portfolio Risk & Return Analysis of 4 USA Banks.xlsx`\
2.  Navigate through sheets for:
    -   **Raw Data**\
    -   **Return Calculations**\
    -   **Risk Metrics**\
    -   **Visualization Charts**\
3.  Adjust portfolio weights or add new tickers to extend the analysis.

## ⚠️ Limitations and Future Research  

1. The analysis does not incorporate **transaction costs or tax effects**, which may affect net returns.  
2. The **risk-free rate** is treated as static (4.02%); future work should use **dynamic Treasury yields** for greater accuracy.  
3. **Scenario-based stress testing** could extend the robustness of results, especially under crisis simulations (e.g., COVID-19, 2008 GFC).  
4. Future research may incorporate **GARCH volatility modeling** or **regime-switching frameworks** to capture time-varying market dynamics.
